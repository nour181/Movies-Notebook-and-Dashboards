# Movies-Notebook-and-Dashboards

I have used Python for Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

and after that I create four tables to make data model with power bi and create Movies Dashboard

first: Movies Notebook:

I used python and python packages(Pandas, NumPy) for data Assessing, Cleaning, EDA, and Draw Conclusions 



first: Movies Dashboard:

this is Movie Dashboard contains three pages:

1) Movies Profits 

2) Genre Details

3) Movie Details



* before creating dashboards I made some changes:

1) Validate Data Type

2) Using Power Query & DAX to add columns for Analysis purpose 

3) Make Key Measures

4) Create a Data Model Between Tables
